/*   Notes:
 - only generates the feature logging per bitpos per day per user dimension
    - the approach provided in documentation is a cartesian join
    - cartesian join approach spools out at many customer sites
 - must be loaded to Transcend to continue:
    - unpivot to row-based bitpos
    - map bitpos to Feature_ID, based on DBSVersion
 - why DBSVersion?
    - there was a regression in FUL, where a new feature was added to the middle
    - caused bit-shift of all bits after that introduction
    - regression was corrected
    - per engineering:
      The regression of mis-aligned bits occurred from build 16.20.33.01
      and above until the builds before 16.20.53.07 build.
      Builds starting from 16.20.53.07 and above are GOOD.
   - this will be accounted for in the coa_dim_feature table in Transcend
