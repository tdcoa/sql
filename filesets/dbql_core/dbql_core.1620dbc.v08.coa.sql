 DBQL_CORE ()
=========================
Aggregates DBQL into a per-day, per-hour, per-DIM (app/statement/user) buckets
as defined above.  The intention is this to be a smaller table than the
detail, however, this assumption largely relies on how well the bucketing
logic is defined / setup above.  If the result set is too large, try
revisiting the Bucket definitions above, and make groups smaller / less varied.

Also - many compound metrics have been stripped, to minimize transfer file
size.  As these fields are easily calculated, they will be re-constituted
in Transcend.
