/*
 Version: 1.0
 Date: 28-06-2020
 Description: 
 - Updated for VCM 2.0 GA
 - Reports CPU hours and Logical IO as Vantage Unit columns(CPU_VU, IO_VU)
   from DBQL tables by date and per hour granularity.
 - Excludes system errors and users for calculating Vantage Units
 - Phase wise Utility Data for Load Jobs 
 - Reports from current date to 365 days back (1 year data)
 - Does not handle NOS system errors
 - CPU_VU column gives the CPU based VU
 - IO_VU column gives the Logical IO based VU
 - LogDate will give the dates
 - It will return the data for last one year
