The following query calculates how much CPU is consumed by a business group when it accesses a certain data domain. 
The amount of CPU consumed is equally distributed across the number of subject areas accessed.
How much CPU is consumed by a department when it accesses a certain data domain. 
The amount of CPU consumed is equally distributed across the number of data domains accessed.
