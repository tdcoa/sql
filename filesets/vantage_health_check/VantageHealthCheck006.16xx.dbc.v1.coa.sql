CPU Trend Spma AvgCPUBusyPct
CPU Utilization 4-Hour Variable Peak from ResusageSpma (Viewpoint CPU Utilization Method).  
•	Evaluates the percentage of time CPU’s in the collection period that CPU’s were busy processing requests (CPUUServ + CPUUExec 0
•	AvgCPUBusyPct is an average of CPU utilization across the entire system. The premise is that when CPU’s reach 80% busy (i.e., reserve capacity level) the system will likely suffer performance impact.   
•	Evaluates 365 days of history (weekdays only) and the busiest 4-hours of each day (whenever they occur).  Peak periods are contiguous 4-hour periods (not individual hours) and may vary (PeakStart & PeakEnd displayed in result) depending on utilization.  
•	Peak periods may start on one day and end in the next – peak periods are always recorded on the day in which they end.
•	Simple linear regression is used to determine trend line with slope & intercept.
•	The slope of the trend line is used to extend anticipated usage 365 days into the future or when utilization is forecasted to exceed 100% (whichever comes first). 
•	21 day Moving Average is included to emphasize recent activity in addition to the longer trend (typically 21 business days in a calendar month).
•	Reserve Capacity is set at 80% (workload performance will likely be impacted when CPU’s exceed 80% utilization).
•	Reserve Horizon represents the (future) point in time at which utilization is expected to exceed 80%.
•	Slope is the daily percentage increase/decrease in utilization of the trend line (positive = increasing utilization, negative = decreasing utilization). 
•	SQL uses UNION to combine historical trend with future forecast – identical changes typically must be made to both SQL statements in UNION.
